#Dotabuff Scraper

## Milestone 3: Prototype finding the individual page for each entry

Dotabuff provides structured pages for each hero which this scraper scrapes. The fields scraped are the hero name, portrait, win rate, and item data. This data changes on a weekly basis, and therefore, repeat scraping will have seperate data for win rate and items, allowing trends to be drawn from this data.
